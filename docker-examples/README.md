# Docker CTF-style Demos

In these demos, you take the role of a hacker and there's an organization with a cheeky web developer/admin.

Your goal is always to get to the internal clients database and crack a couple!

## How to use

Assuming you have `docker` installed, run `run-docker.sh`

You can access the first challenge at `http://localhost:8001/index.html`.

You can access the second challenge at `http://localhost:8002/index.html`.

You can access the third challenge at `http://localhost:8003/index.php`.

## Cleaning up environment

To clean up, stop the docker containers with `docker stop hashes1 hashes2 hashes3`
