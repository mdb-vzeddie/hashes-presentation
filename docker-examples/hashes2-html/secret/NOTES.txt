Fine! We'll hash the passwords but THAT'S IT.

I bet we're already losing 0.000000001% efficiency by utilizing CPU cycles to hash passwords for our clients.

By the way, good news- we can finally allow our clients to log in! There's nothing behind the login screen but 
  we want them to know we are doing something with their millions of dollars of investment!
We've removed the backup database. Now only anyone with "admin" in their title can view the database after they've logged in.
